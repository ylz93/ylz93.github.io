I am Yilang Zhao, Ph. D., Assistant Professor of Educational Data Science at the Department of Counseling, School, and Educational Psychology at University at Buffalo. My research interests include computational mixed methods, educational data science, data science education, mathematics education, constructionism, embodied cognition, and so on. My core ideology is to infuse STEM education in various learning settings and leverage students' interests, previous experiences, and prior knowledge to provide them with meaningful STEM learning experiences.

My works have been published in several high IF journals, such as Journal of Science Education and Technology, Mind, Culture, and Activity, and Education Science. I have also presented my works in various national and international conferences, such as AERA (American Education Research Association) Annual Meetings and ICLS (International Conference of Learning Sciences).

I have a diverse academic background. My bachelor's degree is in the Internet of Things, a branch of computer engineering that has a mixed focus of hardware and software development. In 2015, I went to Michigan State for my master's degree in Media and Information with focuses on human-computer interaction and serious game design & development. During my master's program, I was a game developer and later a research associate working for Dr. Catherine Ryu, a linguistics professor, and became extremely interested in applying games and interactives in the field of education. From 2018 to 2023, I completed my Ph. D. in Curriculum and Instruction at University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison under supervision of Drs. Matthew Berland and Mitchell Nathan. During my doctoral program, I extended my research interests and finished my dissertation that investigated youth learning vector addition through concreteness fading. My postdoc training was at University of Tennessee, Knoxville, where I closely worked with Drs. Lynn Hodge and Joshua Rosenberg on transdisciplinary data science education.

Outside academia, I love hiking and fishing. I enjoyed the quiet woods in East Lansing, the stunning lake view in Madison, the vibrant city walk in Ohio, and the splendid great smoky mountains in East Tennessee. I recharge myself by immersing in those places and embracing the mother nature. Fishing is my another favorite. Staring at the lake surface, sensing the subtle vibration of the fishing line, catching the timing of bite, and fighting against the strength from the underwater... Fishing teaches me to enjoy the process rather than to worry about the product. Find more on my projects page!
