I started my fishing journey in 2021. I have been fishing at Alum Creek Lake (OH), Hoover Reservoir (OH), Charleston (SC), and Fort Loudoun Lake (TN).

Most of my catches were sunfish (bluegills, green sunfish, warmouth, pumpkinseed, ...), but I have also gotten largemouth bass.

My most impressive fish was a HUGE redfish while seafishing in Charleston, SC. Unfortunately, the cost of this fish was a back injury that troubled me for over a month. : (

Currently, I am still searching for good fishing spots in Knoxville, TN.
