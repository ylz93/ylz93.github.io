Mathematizing, Visualizing, and Power (MVP): Appalachian Youth Becoming Data Artists for Community Learning is a three-year NSF-funded research project (NSF Award Number: 2215004) that focuses on community-centered data exploration catalyzed by youth. The project develops statistical artistry among young people in East Tennessee Appalachian communities and enables these youth to share their data visualizations with their communities to foster collective reflection and understanding. The creative work generated by the MVP project will be compelling in two ways, both as statistical art and as powerful statements giving voice to the experience of communities. Critical aspects of the MVP model include (1) youth learning sessions that position youth as owners of data and producers of knowledge and (2) Community Learning Events that support community learning as youth learning occurs. The MVP project has a primary focus on broadening the STEM participation of underrepresented communities of Appalachia. The projectâ€™s mission is to increase the learning and life outcomes of young people and communities of Appalachia by creating a meaningful foundation of data science and collective data exploration.

The MVP project had four cycles from Spring 2023 to Summer 2024. I joined this project in Summer 2023. My primary roles are 1) leading the on-site data collection (Cycle 2 and Cycle 3 HS site), 2) leading the data processing team, 3) leading the research on three aspects (youth data science learning, youth data-art connections, and data science for social good), and 4) results dissemination. After I joined the MVP project, I've led a journal article that explores youth's data-art connections and has been accepted to Journal of Science Education and Technology {% cite Zhao2024-lb %}, one AERA 2024 annual meeting symposium presentation {% cite Zhao2024-dp %}, and two ICLS 2024 presentations {% cite zhao2024exploring %} {% cite zhao2024data %}. I have also collaborated with colleagues on conference presentations at ICLS 2024 {% cite schafer2024role %} and PME annual conference 47 {% cite Hodge2024-j %}. I am also preparing manuscripts that focus on youth's personal data relevance and engagement in the MVP program.

Below are the pictures from the MVP program.
