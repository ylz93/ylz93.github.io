As a gamer and learning science researcher, I am particularly interested in how people learn in video games, specifically how people reflect on their in-game behaviors and adjust strategies. I designed a study to enable people to "think aloud" and use a structured reflection sheet to reveal their reflection processes while playing games.

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/project/sr/sr1.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/project/sr/sr2.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">

I used two games in this study. The first game was called <em>Beats Empire</em> (<https://play.beatsempire.org/>) that was an educational game for middle schoolers' data literacy learning, and the second game was <em>Slay the Spire</em> (<https://www.megacrit.com/>) that was a popular turn-based card game. Both games were turn-based, which allowed players ample time to reflect, and required extensive strategizing and decision-making based on previous actions.

The research findings from this project have been presented in various conferences, including 2019 Inaugural Symposium on Computer Science and Learning Sciences {% cite Zhao2019-ot %}, ICQE 2019 {% cite Zhao2019-yw %}, AERA 2021 {% cite Zhao2021-zr %}, and AERA 2023 {% cite Zhao2023-vx %}.
