Vector addition is a critical skill in STEM education. In a traditional upper middle school/early high school math classroom, vector addition has been taught in a counterintuitive way full of formal symbols and annotations that often confuse students. Inspired by Bruner's three stages of perceiving a new concept–enactive, iconic, and abstract–I designed an intervention that aimed to provide middle school students with meaningful vector addition learning experiences. Besides, I also designed a constructionist math story making activity to enable students to present their learning outcomes.

I completed my dissertation project at a charter school with over 20 students in Columbus, Ohio. I want to express my sincere gratitude to Ms. Jamie Gibson, the principal of Horizon Science Academy Columbus Middle School. Without her help, this project would have never been implemented.

The research findings from this project have been published/accepted to be published on several journals {% cite zhao2024tiles %}{% cite Zhao2024-sj %}. I have also presented my preliminary findings from this project at AERA 2023 {% cite Zhao2023-ht %} and ISLS 2023 {% cite zhao2023vector %}{% cite zhao2023probing %}.
